CTI Report,Extraction Result
"On January 5, 2023, an advanced persistent threat was detected targeting our network. The report indicated that the attackers initially used spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain entry into the system. Following this initial access, they executed a series of scripts to maintain persistence and later attempted lateral movement to access additional resources.",Initial Access / Execution
"""On March 15, 2024, a cyber threat actor gained unauthorized access by exploiting a known vulnerability in the company's web server. After gaining initial access, they escalated privileges using a misconfigured admin account. Subsequently, they established a backdoor for persistent access and attempted to exfiltrate sensitive customer records to an external server.""",Command and Control
"REDBALDKNIGHT, also known as BRONZE BUTLER and Tick, is a cyberespionage group known to target Japanese organizations such as government agencies (including defense) as well as those in biotechnology, electronics manufacturing, and industrial chemistry. Their campaigns employ the Daserf backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_DASERF, otherwise known as Muirim and Nioupale) that has four main capabilities: execute shell commands, download and upload data, take screenshots, and log keystrokes. Our recent telemetry, however, indicates that variants of Daserf were not only used to spy on and steal from Japanese and South Korean targets, but also against Russian, Singaporean, and Chinese enterprises. We also found various versions of Daserf that employ different techniques and use steganography\\x97embedding codes in unexpected mediums or locations (i.e., images)\\x97to conceal themselves better. Like many cyberespionage campaigns, REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s attacks are intermittent but drawn-out. In fact, REDBALDKNIGHT has been zeroing in on Japanese organizations as early as 2008\\x97at least based on the file properties of the decoy documents they\\x92ve been sending to their targets. The specificity of their targets stems from the social engineering tactics used. The decoy documents they use in their attack chain are written in fluent Japanese, and particularly, created via the Japanese word processor Ichitaro. One of the decoy documents, for instance, was about the \\x93plan of disaster prevention in heisei 20\\x94 (Heisei is the current/modern era in Japan). REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s attacks typically use spear phishing emails as an entry point. Their attachments exploit a vulnerability in Ichitaro, as shown above. These are decoy documents, often used by cyberespionage groups as a distraction while they execute their malware behind the scenes using lures such as \\x93CPR\\x94 and \\x93disaster prevention.\\x94 Daserf will be installed and launched on the affected machine once the victim opens the document. Daserf wasn\\x92t well-known until security researchers publicly disclosed it last year, and whose beginnings they\\x92ve traced as far back as 2011. Based on the hardcoded version number they divulged (Version:1.15.11.26TB Mini), we were able to source other versions of the backdoor (listed in the appendix). Our analyses revealed Daserf regularly undergo technical improvements to keep itself under the radar against traditional anti-virus (AV) detection. For instance, Daserf versions 1.50Z, 1.50F, 1.50D, 1.50C, 1.50A, 1.40D, and 1.40C use encrypted Windows application programming interfaces (APIs). Version v1.40 Mini uses the MPRESS packer, which provides some degree of protection against AV detection and reverse engineering. Daserf 1.72 and later versions use the alternative base64+RC4 to encrypt the feedback data, while others use different encryption such as 1.50Z, which uses the Ceasar cipher (which substitutes letters in plaintext with another that corresponds to a number of letters, either upwards or downwards). More notably, REDBALDKNIGHT integrated steganography to conduct second-stage, command-and-control (C&C) communication and retrieve a second-stage backdoor. This technique has been observed in Daserf v1.72 Mini and later versions. Daserf\\x92s use of steganography not only enables the backdoor to bypass firewalls (i.e., web application firewalls); the technique also allows the attackers to change second-stage C&C communication or backdoor faster and more conveniently. Daserf\\x92s infection chain accordingly evolved, as shown below. It has several methods for infecting its targets of interest: spear phishing emails, watering hole attacks, and exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836, patched last March 2017) in SKYSEA Client View, an IT asset management software widely used in Japan. A downloader will be installed on ther victim\\x92s machine and retrieve Daserf from a compromised site. Daserf will then connect to another compromised site and download an image file (i.e., .JPG, .GIF). The image is embedded in either the encrypted backdoor configurations or hacking tool. After their decryption, Daserf will connect to its C&C and await further commands. Daserf 1.72 and later versions incorporate steganographic techniques. REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s use of steganography isn\\x92t limited to Daserf. We also found two of their toolkits employing the same technique\\x97xxmm2_builder, and xxmm2_steganography. Based on their pdb strings, they\\x92re both components of another REDBALDKNIGHT-related threat, XXMM (TROJ_KVNDM), a downloader Trojan that can also act as a first-stage backdoor with its capability to open a shell. While xxmm2_builder allows REDBALDKNIGHT to customize the settings of XXMM, xxmm2_ steganography is used to hide malicious code within an image file. REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s tool can create, embed, and hide executables or configuration files within the image file with its tag and encrypted strings via steganography. An encrypted string can be an executable file or a URL. A threat actor will use/upload an existing image that the builder then injects with steganographic code. Additionally, we also found that the steganography algorithm (alternative base64 + RC4) between XXMM and Daserf were the same. Steganography is a particularly useful technique in purposeful cyberattacks: the longer their malicious activities stay undetected, the more they can steal and exfiltrate data. And indeed, the routine is increasingly gaining cybercriminal traction, in varying degrees of proficiency\\x97from exploit kits, malvertising campaigns, banking Trojans, and C&C communication to even ransomware. In the case of REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s campaigns, the use of steganography is further compounded by their use of malware that can better evade detection and analysis. REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s continuous campaigns\\x97along with their diversity and scope\\x97highlight the importance of defense in depth. Organizations can mitigate these threats by enforcing the principle of least privilege to reduce their opportunities for lateral movement significantly. Network segmentation and data categorization help in this regard. Mechanisms like access control and blacklisting as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems help further secure the network while whitelisting (e.g., application control) and behavior monitoring help detect and block anomalous activities from suspicious or unknown files. Safeguard the email gateway to defend against REDBALDKNIGHT\\x92s spear phishing methods. Disable unnecessary and outdated components or plug-ins, and ensure that the system administration tools are used securely, as they can be misused by threat actors. And more crucially, keep the infrastructure and its applications up-to-date to reduce attack surface\\x97from the gateways and networks to endpoints, and servers.",Initial Access / Execution / Persistence / Privilege Escalation / Defense Evasion / Credential Access / Discovery / Lateral Movement / Collection / Exfiltration / Command and Control / Impact / Resource Development / Reconnaissance
"FIN7, also known as Carbanak Group, is a financially motivated cybercriminal organization known for conducting large-scale campaigns targeting businesses worldwide, particularly in the retail, restaurant, and hospitality industries. FIN7 often gains initial access through sophisticated spear phishing attacks, tricking employees into opening malicious documents embedded with VBA macros or exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. Once inside the network, FIN7 deploys custom malware, such as Carbanak and Griffon, to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the victimâ€™s environment. The group is also known for leveraging PowerShell scripts, encoded payloads, and process injection techniques to evade detection. FIN7 utilizes stolen credentials to gain access to payment processing systems, allowing them to exfiltrate credit card data. The stolen data is then monetized on underground forums or used for further financial fraud. To maintain command and control, FIN7 employs multiple layers of obfuscation, including encrypted C2 traffic and domain fronting techniques. Their operations demonstrate a high level of sophistication, often resembling those of nation-state actors rather than typical cybercriminal groups. In addition to data theft, FIN7 has been observed deploying ransomware such as REvil to maximize financial gains. The group continuously evolves its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to bypass modern security defenses, making it a persistent and dangerous threat to financial and business sectors worldwide.",Initial Access / Execution / Persistence / Privilege Escalation / Defense Evasion / Credential Access / Discovery / Lateral Movement / Collection / Exfiltration / Command and Control / Impact / Resource Development
